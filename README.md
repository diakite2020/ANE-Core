# Core 

This extension doesn't provide any functionality in itself but supports some of our other extensions. It's a centralised location for some common actions that can cause issues if they are implemented in each individual extension. 

Where directed, include this ANE and call the following along with the other ANE initialisations.


```
Core.init();
```

Our extensions are available at:
