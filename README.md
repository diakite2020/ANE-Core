# Core 

This extension doesn't provide any functionality in itself but supports some of our other extensions. 
It's a centralised location for some common actions that can cause issues if they are implemented in 
each individual extension. 

There are two main purposes of this ANE:
- Manage global notifications required by multiple ANEs 
- Centralise libraries to avoid conflicts 

Where directed, include this ANE and call the following along with the other ANE initialisations.

```as3
Core.init();
```
