# Core ANEs

The following summarises the functionality in each of the ANEs. You should only ever include 
one of these ANEs and never use them together.

Generally you should only use the `com.distriqt.Core.ane`. 

>
> Do **NOT** use the `com.distriqt.Core.noair.ane` unless you have been directed by our support team

## Core

This is the most commonly used ANE. It contains the entire Core library which is used by most 
of distriqt's ANEs. If you are directed to include the Core ANE in the documentation then this 
is the ANE you should be using.



## Core.noair

This ANE is only to be used in situations where you are experiencing a conflict with another ANE 
provider. We cannot gaurantee that this will resolve your issues, but is a step to help our ANEs
be as compatible as possible.
